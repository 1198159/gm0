Tips And tricks
===============
Below is a collection of tips and tricks on basic building. Some of them may
seem obvious, but almost every  FTC newbie made these mistakes at least once.


* **Color code your tools**. If you are using several different sizes of hex
  drivers (e.g. 2.5 mm and 3 mm used in goBILDA), color code them, using
  different color electric tape for different sizes.

* **Avoid set screws**.  Set screws easily come loose, causing the hub to slip. In
  addition, set screws damage the axle, sometimes making it very hard to remove
  the hub later. For these reasons, whenever possible, use clamping hubs and
  collars instead of set screw ones. If you must use set screw hubs, use blue
  (non-permanent) loctite to prevent them from loosening.


* **Only use locknuts**. Never use regular nuts in your builds - they easily
  come loose under vibration. Kep nuts used in TETRIX are better, but they are
  still prone to coming loose. For best results, always use nylon locknuts.

* **Do not use socket head screws on plastic**. Using socket head screws for
  attaching plastic parts (in particular, for attaching servos) damages the
  plastic. Use button head screws instead, or use socket head screws with washers.

* **Make sure screws are not hitting anything**. When you are attaching a part,
  make sure the screw you are using is not longer than the depth of the
  threaded hole - otherwise, the screw will hit the bottom of the hole and you
  will be unable to tighten it properly. This situation commonly happens when
  attaching parts to a t-slot extrusion (Misumi, REV, goBILDA's goRAIL) - if
  the screw is too long, it will hit the bottom of the slot, and no matter
  how hard you try, you won't get a tight connection. Another case when this
  situation arises  is when using attachment blocks where two screw holes
  intersect - if you are not careful, you could have one screw hitting another.

* **Never connect two components which both have  threaded holes**. To get
  tight connection, the screw should go through an **unthreaded** hole in one
  component into a **threaded**  hole in another, or through  two unthreaded holes
  into a nut.
