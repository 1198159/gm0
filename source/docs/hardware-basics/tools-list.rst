Tools List
==========
Here are a selection of necessary and helpful tools for your team.
You'll obviously need to purchase the basics such as the right screwdriver,
hex keys, and drill bits.
For a bit more precision and the ability to dabble in custom,
opt for a drill press and bandsaw.
A router might be useful for teams interested in working with wood,
a great material for prototyping (and also for final iterations!)
