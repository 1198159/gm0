<h1>Types of Intake<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-intake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Horizontal/top Intake</dt>
<dd>A horizontal intake generally is a wider style of intake that has the intake
rotating on a horizontal axis or plane.
Horizontal intakes are generally used for intaking smaller game elements,
as these types of intakes can control more than one piece at a time.
Horizontal intakes have been used successfully in games such as Res-Q and Rover
Ruckus, where teams needed to pick up small cubes and balls from the floor.</dd>
<dt>Vertical Intake</dt>
<dd>A vertical intake typically has wheels or other intake components rotating on a
vertical axis (the z-axis).
Vertical intakes are more controllable,
as they can only pick up one element at a time.
Vertical intakes excel at picking up large game elements which would be
impossible to control more than one piece at once,
such as the foam glyphs in Relic Recovery.</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Below are different implementations of horizontal and vertical intakes.</em></p>
<div class="section" id="roller-and-wheeled-intakes">
<h2>Roller and Wheeled Intakes<a class="headerlink" href="#roller-and-wheeled-intakes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Roller and wheeled intakes refer to types of intakes which work by having some
sort of hard or pliable object rotate along an axis.
Wheeled intakes use different kinds of wheels
(solid traction, compliant, or foam wheels) that propel the game element to the
collection bin.
Roller intakes are wider, and can sometimes intake more than one game element.</p>
<div class="section" id="solid-wheel-intake">
<h3>Solid Wheel Intake<a class="headerlink" href="#solid-wheel-intake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Solid wheel intakes use wheels such as grip and traction wheels to pick up game
elements.
They can be effective in picking up large game elements which do not have much
tolerance difference.
However, compliant wheel intakes generally will be more effective because
compliant wheels offer more adjustability and forgiveness for the game elements.
Compliant wheels also accounting for different game element orientations
(the game pieces can get rotated when being controlled) and intake angles
(the orientation of the game piece before it reaches the intake).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compliant-wheel-intake">
<h3>Compliant Wheel Intake<a class="headerlink" href="#compliant-wheel-intake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The compliant wheel intake is most commonly used with large game elements such
as the glyphs in the 2017-2018 season, Relic Recovery.
In this game, robots had to pick up glyphs, which were 6 inch foam cubes,
from the center pit and place them in the cryptobox.
This game had many wheeled intakes primarily because the wheels had consistent
and controllable contact with the glyphs.
Wheeled intakes were able to propel the glyphs in a consistent fashion from the
point of contact to the deposit plate,
which would flip up to deposit the glyphs.</p>
<p>Wheeled intakes can be spring-loaded or locked into place.
A spring-loaded intake is able to pivot in order to accommodate a game element
when it is passing through the intake,
but will snap back when the element has gone through.
A spring-loaded intake requires more thought,
but guarantees that the intake wheel will always be in contact with the desired
element.
A locked intake simply means that the wheels are locked into place and cannot
pivot.
Teams could choose one or mix; in Relic Recovery,
some teams spring-loaded the set of wheels that made contact first,
and then had a fixed set in the back.
This is up to the design team’s choosing.</p>
<p>Wheeled intakes operate at much slower RPM than surgical tubing intakes,
as wheeled intakes are meant to pick up <strong>one</strong> element at a time.
They generally require more torque than a surgical tubing intake,
which is geared for speed.</p>

<h3>Foam Wheel Intake<a class="headerlink" href="#foam-wheel-intake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A foam wheel intake has the same principles as a compliant wheel intake,
except that it uses foam wheels.
It is generally recommended that teams stick to compliant wheels as they are
grippier and easier to control.</p>

<div class="section" id="rubber-band-intake">
<h3>Rubber Band Intake<a class="headerlink" href="#rubber-band-intake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rubber band intakes, commonly used by in the VEX Robotics Competition,
generally feature sprockets, wheels, or gears at two ends,
with rubber bands interlaced in between to form a pliable and bendable roller.
Generally, it can be actuated or adjustable with a servo,
although this is not necessary.
Rubber band intakes are great with intaking balls, but not so great with other
types of game elements such as cubes.
It generally is slower than a surgical tubing intake,
and requires multiple stages to transfer elements from collection to deposit.
Zip ties can be added to increase the intake’s range to accommodate for smaller
balls.</p>

<div class="section" id="tubing-intakes">
<h2>Tubing Intakes<a class="headerlink" href="#tubing-intakes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tubing or noodle intakes typically use some sort of pliable tubing,
which is rotated at high RPM to intake game pieces.
Tubing intakes are particularly efficient at picking up small objects such as
the balls and cubes from Res-Q, Velocity Vortex, and Rover Ruckus.</p>
<div class="section" id="surgical-tubing-intake">
<h3>Surgical Tubing Intake<a class="headerlink" href="#surgical-tubing-intake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Surgical tubing or spearfishing rubber tubing,
sold by many different manufacturers,
is a great option for picking up small game elements such as the minerals from
Res-Q or Rover Ruckus.
Surgical tubing intakes can, and often,
have multiple sets of tubing in order to move minerals from the collection point
to the holding box.
This was most often seen in games where robots had to transfer minerals from the
field to an elevated location.
Unlike wheeled and rubber band intakes,
surgical tubing intakes are practically always fixed at a certain height and
angle.</p>
<p>Surgical tubing by itself is soft and pliable.
Teams have two options:
1) increase the RPM to 800-1000+ RPM,
or use polyurethane tubing at a lower RPM (100-250 RPM).
Polyurethane tubing can be purchased at a local hardware store and is a clear
tubing that is quite stiff.
Using some lubricant, insert the clear tubing into the surgical tubing for added
stiffness.
It is encouraged that teams test different RPMs and stiffness to develop the
optimal intake.</p>
<p>Surgical tubing intakes are especially good at picking up multiple elements at a
time, due to the high RPM (sometimes &gt;1000 RPM) of the rollers.
However, it suffers from a lack of controllability,
as sometimes the driver may accidentally pick up more than needed,
and have to spit it out.</p>

<h3>Zip Tie Intake<a class="headerlink" href="#zip-tie-intake" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Instead of using surgical tubing, some teams opt for heavy zip ties instead.
This can work, but we recommend surgical tubing as it is one of the most tried
and tested methods for picking up nearly any game element.</p>

<p>TPU/NinjaFlex 3D printer filament is a great low-RPM intake flap option,
if designed right they work very well with VEX 393 motors
