The FTC control system is based on using Android phones as a “Robot Controller” 
and a “Driver Station.” 
The two major control systems of FTC are Modern Robotics and REV; 
however, nearly all teams are shifting over to REV because it is cheaper, 
simpler, and more reliable. 
More information about the FTC Control system can be found below.
