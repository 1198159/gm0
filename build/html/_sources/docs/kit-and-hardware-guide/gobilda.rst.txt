goBILDA
=======
goBILDA is a fixed-pitch, channel based building system that was fully released 
in the 2018-2019 season. 
The goBILDA build system revolves around 48mm aluminum U-channels and the 
pattern features a unique 8mm grid with 16mm square clocked slots. 
It uses a metric hole pattern, M4 screws, 8mm pitch chain, HTD 3 belt, 
and metric shafts (6mm D). 
goBILDA’s robust motion system, which is all metric, allows teams to easily 
build drivetrains and mechanisms without worrying about placement and 
tensioning. 
Much like Actobotics, it is channel based with an additional extrusion system 
for flexibility and adjustability. 
Unlike Actobotics, however, low-side channel (smaller profile channel) is the 
foundational building material to supplement full size U-channel. 
Even though this may initially seem like a stepback, 
the use of low side channel opens up many new possibilities such as a kit-based 
parallel plate drivetrain. 
Additionally, goBILDA is still being developed at a quick pace and is responsive 
to the needs of the FTC community.

Advantages
==========
* goBILDA's low sized U-channel opens up many new possibilities due to its flexibility and compactness. For example, one can now make a parallel plate drivetrain without custom machining, or make custom width U-channel. 
* goBILDA also has ServoBlocks (identical to Actobotics other than hole pattern) which drastically increase servo life. 
* goBILDA has native large bore hex shaft support (12mm REX is comparable to ⅜ Thunderhex) which is one of the main advantages of custom fabrication brought to a kit based system. 
* goBILDA also is able to interface with TETRIX channel because they share some holes. For more information about TETRIX-goBILDA compatibility, check out this `website <https://gobildatetrix.blogspot.com/>`_.
* goBILDA has a well thought-out ball bearing based motion system with smart motion transfer. It is easy to do chain or belt in channel. 8mm chain and HTD 3 belt can do perfect C2C (center to center) on the goBILDA pattern. 
* goBILDA has plenty of shaft, bearing and pillow block options.  
* goBILDA motors can face mount natively into channel, eliminating the need for motor mounts and providing a robust, reliable way to mount motors. 
* goBILDA has some special parts are unavailable in other systems, like square beam shafts.

Disadvantages
=============
* goBILDA is not the cheapest build system; it is relatively equivalent in pricing to Actobotics, but REV is cheaper. 
* To achieve perfect center-to-center (C2C), goBILDA chose to adopt the HTD 3 belt standard. While this is a good choice, note that under extremely high torque loads (like an arm) the belt may skip. An easy way to remedy this would be to 3D print and use the HTD 5 belt standard, which will have perfect C2C on goBILDA channel every 5 bearing holes. 
* Because of metric pattern spacing, goBILDA utilizes 8mm pitch chain, as opposed to the FTC standard #25 Imperial chain. This means that other kits' chain and sprockets won’t work with goBILDA chain and sprockets.
